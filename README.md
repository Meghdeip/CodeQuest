# CodeQuest

Welcome to **CodeQuest** â€“ my personal journey of solving Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Competitive Programming (CP) problems.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This repository is my digital logbook where I:
- Store solved problems from various platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG, etc.)
- Document solution approaches and patterns for quick revision
- Track my coding progress over time

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- **Topic-wise folders**: Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.
- **Problem-wise files**: Each file contains:
  - Problem statement
  - Approach explanation
  - Time & Space complexity
  - Solution code

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Browse the topic folders.
2. Open any file to read my approach and code.
3. Use the solutions for practice, revision, or learning new techniques.

## ðŸ”¥ Motivation
Consistent problem-solving improves:
- Pattern recognition
- Problem breakdown skills
- Interview performance
- Competitive programming speed

## ðŸ“… Update Frequency
I update this repo regularly as I solve new problems.
